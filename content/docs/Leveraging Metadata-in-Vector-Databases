Leveraging Metadata in Vector Databases for Accurate Customer Code Retrieval.

In modern applications, retrieving accurate and relevant information is critical, especially in systems dealing with ambiguous or incomplete user inputs. A practical use case is retrieving a customer code from a database using a customer's name, even if the input contains spelling errors or partial names. Vector databases, combined with metadata, provide an efficient solution for this challenge.

This blog explores how to leverage metadata in vector databases to refine searches, handle ambiguities, and improve the retrieval process using Python.

## **Why Use a Vector Database?**

Vector databases excel in handling semantic similarity searches by leveraging vector embeddings. Instead of relying on exact matches, embeddings capture the semantic essence of data, enabling searches that tolerate spelling errors and partial inputs. However, raw vector similarity might not always be enough. This is where metadata comes into play.

### **What is Metadata?**

Metadata is auxiliary information stored alongside vector embeddings. It provides context about the entities represented by the embeddings and can be used to filter, refine, or rank search results.

For example:
- **Vector**: Embedding representation of a customer name.
- **Metadata**: Additional attributes like `{"name": "John Doe", "code": "CUST001", "region": "North America", "status": "Active"}`.

## **Enhancing Searches with Metadata**

### **1. Refining Search Results**
Metadata allows you to filter results based on specific criteria. For example:
- Retrieve customers only from a specific region.
- Consider only active customers.

### **2. Disambiguating Similar Names**
When multiple embeddings have close similarity scores, metadata like `status`, `region`, or `type` can be used to prioritize the correct match.

### **3. Contextual Searches**
Metadata adds layers of context, enabling targeted searches based on user-defined criteria such as customer type, language, or last updated date.

## **Python Implementation**

Hereâ€™s how to implement a customer code retrieval system using a vector database with metadata filtering. We'll use the **Pinecone** vector database and **sentence-transformers** for generating embeddings.

### **Install Required Libraries**

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers pinecone-client
```

### **Store and Query Data**

```python
import pinecone
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Step 1: Initialize the Embedding Model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Step 2: Initialize Pinecone
pinecone.init(api_key="your-pinecone-api-key", environment="your-environment-name")
index_name = "customer-search"
if index_name not in pinecone.list_indexes():
    pinecone.create_index(index_name, dimension=384)  # Embedding dimension is 384
index = pinecone.Index(index_name)

# Step 3: Store Customer Data with Metadata
customers = [
    {"name": "John Doe", "code": "CUST001", "region": "North America", "status": "Active"},
    {"name": "Jane Smith", "code": "CUST002", "region": "Europe", "status": "Active"},
    {"name": "Jon Do", "code": "CUST003", "region": "North America", "status": "Inactive"},
    {"name": "Janet Smyth", "code": "CUST004", "region": "Europe", "status": "Active"}
]

# Generate embeddings and upsert into Pinecone
for customer in customers:
    embedding = model.encode(customer["name"]).tolist()
    index.upsert([(customer["code"], embedding, {"name": customer["name"], "region": customer["region"], "status": customer["status"]})])

print("Customer data inserted into the vector database.")

# Step 4: Query the Database with Metadata Filtering
def retrieve_customer_code(query_name, region=None, status=None):
    # Generate embedding for the query name
    query_embedding = model.encode(query_name).tolist()

    # Create metadata filter
    metadata_filter = {}
    if region:
        metadata_filter["region"] = region
    if status:
        metadata_filter["status"] = status

    # Perform vector search with metadata filtering
    search_results = index.query(
        vector=query_embedding,
        top_k=3,
        filter=metadata_filter,
        include_metadata=True
    )

    # Parse results
    if search_results["matches"]:
        best_match = search_results["matches"][0]
        customer_name = best_match["metadata"]["name"]
        customer_code = best_match["id"]  # ID is stored as the customer code
        similarity_score = best_match["score"]

        print(f"Query Name: {query_name}")
        print(f"Best Match: {customer_name} (Code: {customer_code}, Score: {similarity_score:.2f})")
        print(f"Metadata: {best_match['metadata']}")
        return customer_code
    else:
        print("No match found.")
        return None

# Example Query
query_name = "Jhn Do"  # Intentionally misspelled
customer_code = retrieve_customer_code(query_name, region="North America", status="Active")
if customer_code:
    print(f"Retrieved Customer Code: {customer_code}")
```

---

## **Output**

### **Scenario**
- **Query Name**: `"Jhn Do"`
- **Metadata Filter**: `{"region": "North America", "status": "Active"}`

### **Result**
```plaintext
Query Name: Jhn Do
Best Match: John Doe (Code: CUST001, Score: 0.91)
Metadata: {'name': 'John Doe', 'region': 'North America', 'status': 'Active'}
Retrieved Customer Code: CUST001
```

## **Key Benefits of Using Metadata**

1. **Precision**:
   - Filters irrelevant results using additional criteria.

2. **Disambiguation**:
   - Resolves conflicts between similar embeddings (e.g., "Jon Do" vs. "John Doe").

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Supports dynamic queries based on context, such as geographical region or customer activity status.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Efficiently handles large datasets with advanced filtering capabilities.

## **Conclusion**

Metadata enhances the power of vector databases by providing context and refining search results. By combining semantic embeddings with metadata filters, we can create robust systems capable of handling real-world challenges like misspelled or incomplete inputs.

With the provided Python implementation, you can quickly build a scalable and precise customer code retrieval system. As vector databases continue to evolve, leveraging metadata will remain a key strategy for improving search relevance and accuracy.
