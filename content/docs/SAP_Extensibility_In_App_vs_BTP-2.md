When working with SAP solutions, one key question always arises: **Should you extend In-App or go Side-by-Side with SAP BTP?**

## **In-App Extensibility** (SAP S/4HANA Cloud)  

In-App Extensibility focuses on enhancing the core SAP system directly. It’s ideal for quick, straightforward changes that don’t require external integrations.  

### **Supported Patterns**:  
- Adapt existing Fiori UIs  
- Create custom forms or email templates  
- Add custom fields or business objects  
- Create queries for analytics  
- Define workflows and rules  
- Enable process integration and data replication  

### **Examples Based on the Patterns**:  
1. **Modify Fiori UI**: Add a “Delivery Priority” dropdown to the sales order app.  
2. **Custom Fields**: Include a “Preferred Supplier” field in procurement documents.  
3. **Queries**: Create a query to list overdue invoices for follow-up.  
4. **Workflows**: Automate the approval process for purchase orders based on thresholds.

## **Side-by-Side Extensibility** (SAP BTP)  

Side-by-Side Extensibility leverages SAP BTP for flexible, scalable innovations that operate outside the SAP core.  

### **Supported Patterns**:  
- Develop independent or dependent custom applications  
- Integrate third-party tools and applications  
- Build event-driven workflows and services  
- Enable advanced process integration and data replication  

### **Examples Based on the Patterns**:  
1. **Custom Application**: Build a supplier performance dashboard combining SAP data with logistics metrics from external providers.  
2. **Third-Party Integration**: Integrate Salesforce with SAP for synchronized customer data.  
3. **Event-Driven Workflows**: Trigger alerts for stock replenishment when inventory levels are critically low.  
4. **Advanced Process Integration**: Connect SAP with payment gateways for automated billing and reconciliation.

## **Key Insights**  

- **In-App Extensibility** is perfect for enhancing the SAP core with minimal complexity.  
- **Side-by-Side Extensibility** unlocks the flexibility to innovate and scale, especially when integrating external systems or creating independent applications.

## **Conclusion**  

Choosing the right extensibility option depends on your business needs:  
- Use **In-App Extensibility** for small, core-centric changes.  
- Opt for **Side-by-Side Extensibility** for advanced integrations and innovation outside the core SAP system.
